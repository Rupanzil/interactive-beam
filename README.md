# Simply Supported Beam Deflection Web App

Welcome to the Interactive Beam App repository! This project showcases a simple web application developed as part of my journey into web development.

## About the Project
As a structural engineer with a growing interest in software engineering, I embarked on the challenge of creating a web application to demonstrate the deflection of a simply supported beam. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed this app from scratch, highlighting the versatility of these languages beyond traditional engineering tools like Python.

## Features
- Visualization of beam deflection under different loads and spans
- Interactive user interface for adjusting beam parameters
- Real-time calculations and graphical representation of deflection

## Getting Started
To explore the Interactive Beam Web App just go to the following [link]()
and adjust the beam parameters using the interactive controls to visualize deflection.
